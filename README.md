## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

- **Go (Golang) Installed**: Ensure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official website](https://golang.org/dl/).
- **Git Installed**: You'll need Git to clone repositories and manage code versions. Download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### **Forking the Repository**

Forking the repository creates a copy under your own GitHub account where you can make changes without affecting the original repository.

1. Go to the [original repository](https://github.com/RezaSi/go-interview-practice).
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top right corner.

### **Cloning Your Fork**

Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-interview-practice.git
```

## **Web UI**

The Go Interview Practice includes a modern, interactive web interface for a more engaging learning experience.

### **Features**

- **Interactive Challenge Browser**: Browse all coding challenges with difficulty filters and sorting options
- **In-browser Code Editor**: Write and edit Go code directly in your browser
- **Integrated Test Runner**: Run tests against your solutions in real-time
- **Learning Materials**: Access detailed learning content for each challenge
- **Scoreboards**: Track your progress and compare with other users
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with intuitive navigation

### **Running the Web UI**

1. Navigate to the web-ui directory:
   ```bash
   cd web-ui
   ```

2. Run the web server:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

3. Open your browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

For more details about the Web UI, check the [web-ui/README.md](web-ui/README.md) file.

## **Working on Challenges**

### **Setting Up Your Submission**

You can set up your submission in two ways:

#### **Method 1: Using the Web UI (Recommended for Development)**

1. Run the web UI as described in the [Web UI](#web-ui) section.
2. Browse challenges and select one to work on.
3. Implement your solution in the in-browser editor.
4. Click "Run Tests" to test your solution.
5. Once all tests pass, click "Submit Solution" to submit your solution to the scoreboard.
6. You will be given the option to either:
   - Save your solution directly to the filesystem with one click
   - Copy the commands to manually create the submission files

#### **Method 2: Using the Command Line**

We have provided a bash script called `create_submission.sh` to help you set up your submission directory and copy the solution template.

**Usage:**

```bash
./create_submission.sh [challenge-number]
```

**Example:**

```bash
./create_submission.sh 1
```

**Steps:**

1. Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository.

2. Run the script with the challenge number you want to work on.

   ```bash
   ./create_submission.sh 1
   ```

3. The script will prompt you to enter your GitHub username. This is used to create a unique submission directory for you.

4. The script will create the directory `challenge-1/submissions/yourusername` and copy the solution template into it.

### **Implementing the Solution**

1. Navigate to your submission directory:

   ```bash
   cd challenge-1/submissions/yourusername/
   ```

2. Open the `solution-template.go` file in your preferred text editor.

3. Implement the required function(s) as specified in the challenge's `README.md`.

### **Running Tests**

Each challenge includes a `run_tests.sh` script to help you run tests against your solution.

**Usage:**

1. Navigate to the challenge directory:

   ```bash
   cd challenge-1
   ```

2. Run the test script:

   ```bash
   ./run_tests.sh
   ```

3. Enter your GitHub username when prompted.

4. The script will run the tests and display the results.

## **Submitting Your Solution**

### **Creating a Pull Request**

1. **Commit Your Changes:**

   ```bash
   git add challenge-1/submissions/yourusername/solution-template.go
   git commit -m "Add Challenge 1 solution"
   ```

2. **Push to Your Fork:**

   ```bash
   git push origin challenge-1-solution
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request:**

   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Click on the "Compare & pull request" button.
   - Submit the pull request to the original repository's `main` branch.

4. **Wait for Automated Feedback:**

   - The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically run tests on your submission.
   - Review the test results in the **Checks** tab of your pull request.
   - If tests pass, your submission will be reviewed and merged.
   - If tests fail, fix the issues and push the changes. The workflow will re-run the tests.

---

## **Scripts and Automation**

We've included two bash scripts to streamline your workflow:

### **create_submission.sh**

This script sets up your submission directory and copies the solution template.

**Location:** Root directory of the repository.

**Usage:**

```bash
./create_submission.sh [challenge-number]
```

**What It Does:**

- Prompts you for your GitHub username.
- Creates a submission directory under `challenge-[number]/submissions/yourusername`.
- Copies the `solution-template.go` into your submission directory.
- Initializes the Go module if necessary.

### **run_tests.sh**

This script runs the tests against your solution.

**Location:** Inside each challenge directory (e.g., `challenge-1/run_tests.sh`).

**Usage:**

```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

**What It Does:**

- Prompts you for your GitHub username.
- Copies your solution file into the challenge directory.
- Runs the tests.
- Cleans up any temporary files used during testing.

## **Challenge List**

The challenges are organized in increasing difficulty from beginner to advanced levels. Start from the easier ones if you're new to Go, and progress to the more complex ones as you build your skills. You can access these challenges through the Web UI or directly via code files.

Each challenge includes:
- Detailed problem statement
- Function signature to implement
- Test cases to validate your solution
- Learning materials related to the concepts required for the challenge
